# terraform-vpc
This repo having the terraform code to create the VPC with Public &amp; Private subnets.

Terraform is an Infrastructure as a Code product. In this article, we are going to use Terraform to create a complete VPC with Public Subnet & Private Subnet, Internet Gateway, Nat Gateway, Route Tables, EIP and spread across all our defined Availability Zones on AWS. With Terraform, you can easily create a whole new infrastructure by only creating variables, and destroy it with just a single command.
